## Notes  📓
### For adding new faculty members you can't assign a student to the advisor if that student already has one.
### You must add a faculty member with no advisees at first. Then you can use the change advisor feature, delete an advisee from an advisor, or add a new student with the given advisor ID to assign the faculty member with said advisee.
